# dataviz

Academic project for [Data Visualization](https://www.enseignement.polytechnique.fr/informatique/CSC_51052/) course at Ecole Polytechnique.

# NOTES
- the data in the data folder are only the global top 50 songs of 2024, because the other file is to big. Anyways, can we not do most of the visualizations with this data and just for the world map we use everything?)
- can you activate your account on https://plmlatex.math.cnrs.fr so that I can share the link to our report?
